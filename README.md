## Game Summary

**PING PONG!** is a classic arcade game where players control paddles to prevent the ball from entering their goal. Score points by getting the ball past your opponent. The first player to reach 10 points wins!

## Game Outline

Players control paddles that move vertically to block the ball and score points against their opponent. The game is played in a single dimension, up and down movement only.

## Unique Systems

### Pause

Players can pause the game at any time to access the main menu, adjust options, or exit the game.

### Basic Options

Adjust game settings such as resolution, sound effects volume, and visual effects colours.

### Continue Last Game

Automatically save the current game progress. Players can resume their game from where they left off, even after exiting the game.

### Dynamic Ball Speed

The ball speeds up after each bounce and receives a random force when it hits a player's paddle, adding excitement and unpredictability to the gameplay.

## Development in the Future

### Basic AI

Introduce AI opponents with two behavior modes: one that tracks the ball's vertical position and another that predicts the ball's trajectory toward the AI's goal.

### Customizable Winning Scores

Before starting a game, allow players to choose the winning score from options ranging from a quick game of 3 points to a longer game of 10 points.

### Best Of Series

Implement "Best of" series options (1, 3, or 5 games) to enhance competitive play and determine the ultimate winner in a series of matches.
